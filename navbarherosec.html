        <h1>Welcome to Image Comics</h1>
        <p>Image Comics is an American comic book publisher and is the third largest direct 
            market comic book and graphic novel publisher in the industry by market share.[4] 
            Its best-known publications include Spawn, The Walking Dead, Kick-Ass, 
            Invincible, Jupiter's Legacy, Witchblade, The Maxx, Savage Dragon, Bone, Saga, 
            Radiant Black and Stray Dogs.

            It was founded in 1992 by several high-profile illustrators as a venue for creator-
            owned properties, in which comics creators could publish material of their own 
            creation without giving up the copyrights to those properties. Normally this is not 
            the case in the work-for-hire-dominated American comics industry, where the legal 
            author is a publisher, such as Marvel Comics or DC Comics, and the creator is an 
            employee of that publisher. Its output was originally dominated by superhero and 
            fantasy titles from the studios of the founding Image partners, but now includes 
            comics in many genres by numerous independent creators. </p>
