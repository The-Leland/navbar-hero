        <h1>Welcome to Image Comics</h1>
        <p>Image Comics is an American comic book publisher and is the third largest direct 
            market comic book and graphic novel publisher in the industry by market share.[4] 
            Its best-known publications include Spawn, The Walking Dead, Kick-Ass, 
            Invincible, Jupiter's Legacy, Witchblade, The Maxx, Savage Dragon, Bone, Saga, 
            Radiant Black and Stray Dogs.

            It was founded in 1992 by several high-profile illustrators as a venue for creator-
            owned properties, in which comics creators could publish material of their own 
            creation without giving up the copyrights to those properties. Normally this is not 
            the case in the work-for-hire-dominated American comics industry, where the legal 
            author is a publisher, such as Marvel Comics or DC Comics, and the creator is an 
            employee of that publisher. Its output was originally dominated by superhero and 
            fantasy titles from the studios of the founding Image partners, but now includes 
            comics in many genres by numerous independent creators. </p>

   <p>Over the years, Image Comics has maintained a commitment to its core principle of 
    creative ownership, attracting a wide array of talent in the industry. This philosophy has 
    allowed creators to maintain control over their own intellectual properties and has led to 
    some of the most innovative and diverse storytelling in the comic book world. Many of the 
    company's titles have been critically acclaimed and have received numerous awards, 
    further solidifying Image Comics' reputation for high-quality, original content.</p><br>

    <p>Moreover, Image Comics' impact extends beyond just the comic book pages. Several of its 
    properties have been adapted into successful television series, movies, and video games. 
    For instance, "The Walking Dead," created by Robert Kirkman, became a global 
    phenomenon as both a comic series and a television show. This ability to cross into other 
    media has helped Image Comics reach a broader audience and maintain its status as a 
    significant player in the entertainment industry.</p><br>

    <p>This company's unique model and focus on creator rights have not only shaped the comic 
        book industry but also inspired other publishers to adopt similar approaches, fostering a 
        more diverse and vibrant comic book landscape.</p><br>
